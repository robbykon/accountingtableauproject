# Accounting Tableau Project
For this project, we looked at several companies. We specifically looked at two companies in the pharmaceutical industry. We tried to predict CEO compensation and set the CEO compensation for the next year. We used some python to generate a regression model and visualied our results and analysis within Tableau.
